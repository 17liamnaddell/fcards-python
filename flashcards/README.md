#Welcome to  my python certification project
##about
<p>
This project is my pyfun certification project, I will be creating
a terminal based python flashcards program with tons of functionality.
For example, many many modes, a config file, and lots of features.</p>
##usage
Right now, there are three options, create a set, used with -s <name>,
and run, -r. -r will have you select a file with autocompletion. and
-l. -l will list all of the files that you have. If you want to delete a  file, enter -d, there will be an option to delete from a selection of your choice. This also has autocompletion

##moving forward
<ul>
<li>add a delete flashcard button </li>
<li>make the sets directory invisible</li> 
<li>add color coding</li>
<li>fix grammar on everything</li>
<li>add the sets directory file checking and searching if the directory hase moved</li>
<li>compact the program</li>
</ul>
